Copy the PROJECT folder to a location parallel to Orion and start generating
your SCSS. It's that simple.

The _master.scss file is setup with the proper inheritence of components.
Changing the order they are imported may cause some bad juju in your project.

If you copy it to another location, don't forget to adjust the paths in the
_master.scss to import the correct files.
