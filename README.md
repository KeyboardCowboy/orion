# Orion Rapid Prototyping Library
Version 3.x

https://github.com/KeyboardCowboy/orion

Orion is my own library of [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) components and [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) base layouts I've compiled
over time in order to facilitate rapid prototyping for responsive and
cross-browser compatible websites.

## Libraries
Orion integrates various 3rd party libraries:

### Included
Some libraries are included in Orion and are loaded automatically.
- [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) for CSS3 and multi-vendor support (required for Orion to work)
- [Typeplate, v1.1.2](http://typeplate.com) for typography
- [Normalize, v2.1.3](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css) for cross browser consistency

## Optional
Additional libraries are available and do not require additional installation.
- [Zen Grids](http://zengrids.com) for responsive grid layouts
- [Sassy Buttons](http://jaredhardy.com/sassy-buttons) for fun button styles

## Getting Started
1. Copy the _new_project directory out of Orion and into another directory.
2. Check to ensure the paths to Orion are correct inside _master.scss.
3. Start adding your own SCSS.
