# Orion SASS Library
Version 3.x

https://github.com/KeyboardCowboy/orion

Orion is my own library of SASS components I've compiled over time in order
to facilitate rapid prototyping for responsive and cross-browser compatible
websites.

## Why not a normal framework like Bootstrap or Foundation?
Control. Simplicity.  Education.  I like to have control over the tools I'm using,
the manner in which I'm generating my final CSS, the ability to limit what I'm
including per file and above all, I like to understand exactly what's going on
under the hood.  The components included in Orion are just what I like to use.

The CSS Directory is organized in the following manner:

## Libraries
Orion integrates various 3rd party libraries:

### Included
Some libraries are included in Orion and are loaded automatically.
- [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) for CSS3 and multi-vendor support (required for Orion to work)
- [Typeplate, v1.1.2](http://typeplate.com) for typography
- [Normalize, v2.1.3](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css) for cross browser consistency

## Optional
Additional libraries are available and do not require additional installation.
- [Zen Grids](http://zengrids.com) for responsive grid layouts
- [Sassy Buttons](http://jaredhardy.com/sassy-buttons) for fun button styles

## Getting Started
1. Copy the PROJECT directory out of Orion and into another directory.
2. Check to ensure the paths to Orion are correct inside _master.scss.
3. Start adding your own SCSS.
