## Overriding Variables
The variables defined in these files are not natively loaded through cBase.
They are a reference point for you to override the default values used by the
mixins and functions that rely on them.

Copy any of these variables into your subtheme's variables file and import them
before importing any mixin or function files from cBase to override the default
values.
